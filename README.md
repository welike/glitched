Glitched, an iOS client for Glitch.

Glitch was a web-based massively multiplayer game that is now defunct and no longer in service. The company that created it, TinySpeck, is out of business.

We are open sourcing this iOS client because it no longer works, is no longer maintained (hasn't been touched since 2011), and serves no purpose as a private repository. Please note that this was just an experimental client, and could use some severe improvements.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome, but somewhat unnecessary now that the game doesn't even exist.
